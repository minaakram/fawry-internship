Task 2 - Troubleshooting Internal Web Dashboard (internal.example.com)

1. DNS Resolution Verification
I verified DNS resolution using two methods:
- Checking /etc/resolv.conf:
  - Configured to use 127.0.0.53 (systemd-resolved local resolver).
- Testing resolution against 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS):
  - Command used: nslookup internal.example.com 8.8.8.8
  - Result: NXDOMAIN, meaning 8.8.8.8 could not resolve the domain.
- Testing resolution using system default:
  - Command: nslookup internal.example.com
  - Result:
    Name: internal.example.com
    Address: 192.168.1.100

Conclusion:
The local DNS resolver could resolve internal.example.com to 192.168.1.100, but 8.8.8.8 could not. This confirms internal.example.com is only resolvable internally.

2. Diagnose Service Reachability
- curl -I http://localhost
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK (nginx server running locally).
- curl -I http://internal.example.com
  Initially failed: "Connection refused".

- hostname -I showed machine IP: 192.168.152.134
- internal.example.com resolved to: 192.168.1.100

Conclusion:
I was connecting to a different device on the network, not my own machine.

3. Tracing the Issue - Possible Causes
1. No web server running on 192.168.1.100.
2. Web server running but bound only to localhost (127.0.0.1) instead of 0.0.0.0.
3. Firewall blocking port 80.
4. Network misrouting or the target machine being offline.
5. DNS misconfiguration.

4. Proposed and Applied Fixes
- Confirm web server is running:
  sudo systemctl status nginx
- Confirm Nginx is listening on 0.0.0.0:
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
  Confirm:
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
- Reload Nginx after changes:
  sudo systemctl reload nginx

Issue in my case:
The server I was trying to reach was on 192.168.1.100, and I do not have access to that device.

To continue testing, I modified /etc/hosts locally.

Bonus Section
Configuring /etc/hosts
- Added entry:
  127.0.0.1    internal.example.com
- Verified with:
  curl -I http://internal.example.com
- Output confirmed: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Persisting DNS Settings
- systemd-resolved:
  - Edit /etc/systemd/resolved.conf:
    [Resolve]
    DNS=8.8.8.8
    FallbackDNS=1.1.1.1
  - Restart systemd-resolved:
    sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved

- NetworkManager:
  - nmcli dev show
  - sudo nmcli con mod <your-connection-name> ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1"
  - sudo nmcli con up <your-connection-name>

Issues Encountered During Task
- Initially, connection to internal.example.com was refused.
- Confirmed that my machine IP was different from 192.168.1.100.
- Modified /etc/hosts to map internal.example.com to 127.0.0.1 locally.
- After modification, service became reachable.

Conclusion
All required steps have been completed successfully, including troubleshooting DNS resolution, diagnosing service availability, applying fixes, and implementing the bonus tasks.
